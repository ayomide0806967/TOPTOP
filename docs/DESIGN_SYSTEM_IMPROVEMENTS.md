# Design System Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to unify the UI design across all Academic Nightingale applications.

## Changes Made

### 1. Unified Design System (`apps/shared/design-system.css`)

Created a comprehensive design system with:

**Color System:**
- Primary cyan/blue theme (`#06b6d4`, `#0891b2`, `#0e7490`)
- Consistent neutral grays
- Status colors (success, error, warning)
- Dark mode support

**Typography:**
- Font family stack: `ui-sans-serif, system-ui, ...`
- Consistent font sizes and weights
- Proper line heights and spacing

**Spacing & Layout:**
- Standardized spacing scale (4px to 80px)
- Consistent border radius values
- Proper shadow system

**Component Base Styles:**
- Buttons (primary, secondary, ghost)
- Input fields with proper focus states
- Cards with hover effects
- Modal and toast components
- Loading spinners

### 2. Standardized Login Component (`apps/shared/login-component.html`)

Created a reusable login component featuring:

**Accessibility:**
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Screen reader friendly

**User Experience:**
- Password visibility toggle
- Form validation feedback
- Loading states with spinners
- Error/success toast notifications
- Responsive design

**Security:**
- Disabled authentication flag for development
- Proper form submission handling
- Role-based redirection logic

### 3. Application Updates

#### Admin Login (`apps/admin/login.html`)
- Updated to use unified design system
- Loads shared login component
- Maintains admin-specific routing logic
- Improved error handling

#### Quiz Builder Login (`apps/quizbuilder/login.html`)
- Updated to use unified design system
- Loads shared login component
- Quiz Builder specific routing
- Consistent branding

#### Quiz Builder Start Page (`apps/quizbuilder/quiz-builder-start.html`)
- Replaced brown accents with brand colors
- Updated card components to use design system
- Standardized button styles
- Improved visual hierarchy

#### Learner Exam Interface (`apps/learner/exam-face.html`)
- Migrated from Google Forms theme to unified design
- Updated color variables to use design system tokens
- Maintained exam-specific functionality
- Improved visual consistency

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Consistency**
- All applications now use the same color palette
- Consistent component behavior and styling
- Unified typography and spacing

### 2. **Maintainability**
- Single source of truth for design tokens
- Reusable components reduce code duplication
- Easier to make global design changes

### 3. **User Experience**
- Consistent interactions across all apps
- Improved accessibility
- Better responsive behavior
- Professional, polished appearance

### 4. **Developer Experience**
